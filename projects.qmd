## Adoption of the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 Vaccine
This dashboard showcases the results of a nationally representative survey fielded to 281 US residents as part of the Fall 2023 DACSS Survey Research Methods course.

The main objective of my research was to understand how Americans feel about the current state of COVID-19 in the US, and how that might influence their perceptions and use of the newest COVID-19 vaccine, released in the Fall of 2023 (Stapleton 2023).
